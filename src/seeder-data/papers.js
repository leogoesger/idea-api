      'Revealing the Diversity of Natural Hydrologic Regimes in California with Relevance for Environmental Flows Applications',
    description:
      'Alterations to flow regimes for water management objectives have degraded river ecosystems worldwide. These alterations are particularly profound in Mediterranean climate regions such as California with strong climatic variability and riverine species highly adapted to the resulting flooding and drought disturbances. However, defining environmental flow targets for Mediterranean rivers is complicated by extreme hydrologic variability and often intensive water management legacies. Improved understanding of the diversity of natural streamflow patterns and their spatial arrangement across Mediterranean regions is needed to support the future development of effective flow targets at appropriate scales for management applications with minimal resource and data requirements. Our study addresses this need through the development of a spatially explicit reach‐scale hydrologic classification for California. Dominant hydrologic regimes and their physio‐climatic controls are revealed, using available unimpaired and naturalized streamflow time‐series and generally publicly available geospatial datasets. This methodology identifies eight natural flow classes representing distinct flow sources, hydrologic characteristics, and catchment controls over rainfall‐runoff response. The study provides a broad‐scale hydrologic framework upon which flow‐ecology relationships could subsequently be established towards reach‐scale environmental flows applications in a complex, highly altered Mediterranean region.',

      'Classification of California streams using combined deductive and inductive approaches: Setting the foundation for analysis of hydrologic alteration',
    description:
      "Regional classification of streams is an early step in the Ecological Limits of Hydrologic Alteration framework. Many stream classifications are based on an inductive approach using hydrologic data from minimally disturbed basins, but this approach may underrepresent streams from heavily disturbed basins or sparsely gaged arid regions. An alternative is a deductive approach, using watershed climate, land use, and geomorphology to classify streams, but this approach may miss important hydrological characteristics of streams. We classified all stream reaches in California using both approaches. First, we used Bayesian and hierarchical clustering to classify reaches according to watershed characteristics. Streams were clustered into seven classes according to elevation, sedimentary rock, and winter precipitation. Permutation‐based analysis of variance and random forest analyses were used to determine which hydrologic variables best separate streams into their respective classes. Stream typology (i.e., the class that a stream reach is assigned to) is shaped mainly by patterns of high and mean flow behavior within the stream's landscape context. Additionally, random forest was used to determine which hydrologic variables best separate minimally disturbed reference streams from non‐reference streams in each of the seven classes. In contrast to stream typology, deviation from reference conditions is more difficult to detect and is largely defined by changes in low‐flow variables, average daily flow, and duration of flow. Our combined deductive/inductive approach allows us to estimate flow under minimally disturbed conditions based on the deductive analysis and compare to measured flow based on the inductive analysis in order to estimate hydrologic change.",

      'The role of topographic variability in river channel classification',
    description:
      'To date, subreach-scale variations in flow width and bed elevation have rarely been included in channel classifications. Variability in topographic features of rivers, however, in conjunction with sediment supply and discharge produces a mosaic of channel forms that provides unique habitats for sensitive aquatic species. In this study we investigated the utility of topographic variability attributes (TVAs) in distinguishing channel types and dominant channel formation and maintenance processes in montane and lowland streams of the Sacramento River basin, California, USA. A stratified random survey of 161 stream sites was performed to ensure balanced sampling across groups of stream reaches with expected similar geomorphic settings. For each site surveyed, width and depth variability were measured at baseflow and bankfull stages, and then incorporated in a channel classification framework alongside traditional reach-averaged geomorphic attributes (e.g., channel slope, width-to-depth, confinement, and dominant substrate) to evaluate the significance of TVAs in differentiating channel types. In contrast to more traditional attributes such as slope and contributing area, which are often touted as the key indicators of hydrogeomorphic processes, bankfull width variance emerged as a first-order attribute for distinguishing channel types. A total of nine channel types were distinguished for the Sacramento Basin consisting of both previously identified and new channel types. The results indicate that incorporating TVAs in channel classification provides a quantitative basis for interpreting nonuniform as well as uniform geomorphic processes, which can improve our ability to distinguish linked channel forms and processes of geomorphic and ecological significance.',

      'Integrated analysis of flow, form, and function for river management and design testing',
    description:
      "The extent and timing of many river ecosystem functions is controlled by the interplay of streamflow dynamics with the river corridor shape and structure. However, most river management studies evaluate the role of either flow or form without regard to their dynamic interactions. This study develops an integrated modeling approach to assess changes in ecosystem functions resulting from different river flow and form configurations. Moreover, it investigates the role of temporal variability in such flow-form-function tradeoffs. The use of synthetic, archetypal channel forms in lieu of high-resolution topographic data reduces time and financial requirements, overcomes site-specific topographic features, and allows for evaluation of any morphological structure of interest. In an application to California's Mediterranean-montane streams, the interacting roles of channel form, water year type, and hydrologic impairment were evaluated across a suite of ecosystem functions related to hydrogeomorphic processes and aquatic habitat. Channel form acted as the dominant control on hydrogeomorphic processes, while water year type controlled salmonid habitat functions. Streamflow alteration for hydropower increased redd dewatering risk and altered aquatic habitat availability. Study results highlight critical tradeoffs in ecosystem function performance and emphasize the significance of spatiotemporal diversity of flow and form at multiple scales for maintaining river ecosystem integrity. The proposed approach is broadly applicable and extensible to other systems and ecosystem functions, where findings can be used to inform river management and design testing.",
